    <h3>Ch8: Transforms and Transitions</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down. </li>
                <li><a href="week08/transform.html">see examples of transform here</a></li>
                <li>The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically. If only one value is provided, it will be used for both the x and y values, growing or shrinking your element or pseudo-element while maintaining the original aspect ratio. For example, scale(1) would leave the element the same size, scale(2) would double its proportions, scale(0.5) would halve them, and so on. Providing different values will distort the element, as youâ€™d expect:</li>
                <li>rotate</li>
                <li>remember that transforms are applied in the order provided.</li>
                <li>The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes. </li>
                <li>The list of properties that can be animated is found at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animated_properties.</li>
                <li>transition-duration:.02s; 200ms is generally considered the optimum time for a transition: anything slower will make the website seem slow, drawing generally unwanted attention to what was supposed to be a subtle effect. Anything faster may be too subtle. </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Animations...</li>
                <li><a href="week08/transform.html">see examples of Animations here</a></li>

            </ul>
        </p>
    <h3>Ch12: Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>see examples on link above</li>
                <li>Drawing a circle in SVG is arguably easier than drawing a circle with canvas. </li>
                <li><a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/dnd.html">Drag and drop stuff</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DragDrop/Drag_and_Drop">More drag and drop stuff</a></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
